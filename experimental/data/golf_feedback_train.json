    "output": "WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN (Ideal/Expected):\nSetup Quality (stance, posture, alignment). A sound setup creates consistency before the swing even starts. Feet should be shoulder-width apart, spine tilted slightly forward from the hips, arms hanging naturally, and alignment square to the target.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS:\nA poor setup forces compensations later in the swing. Even elite swings break down if posture or alignment is incorrect.\n\nWHAT IS HAPPENING (Current Issue):\nYour setup quality score is 45.0%, suggesting instability or misalignment at address. This is likely affecting balance and swing plane.\n\nCOMMON FAULTS:\n• Rounded shoulders or excessive knee bend\n• Ball too far forward or back\n• Open or closed alignment\n\nWHAT TO DO (Actionable Steps):\n• Use an alignment stick along your toes\n• Practice mirror setup checks before every session\n• Rehearse posture without a club\n\nFEEL / CUE:\n\"Athletic and tall, arms hanging freely\"\n\nPROGRESS CHECK:\nHold your setup for 5 seconds without tension or wobble before swinging."

    "output": "WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN (Ideal/Expected):\nTempo & Rhythm should feel smooth and repeatable. The backswing should be controlled, with a gradual transition into the downswing.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS:\nPower comes from sequencing, not speed. Rushed tempo disrupts timing and reduces strike quality.\n\nWHAT IS HAPPENING (Current Issue):\nYour tempo score of 38.0% indicates rushing the transition or jerky acceleration.\n\nCOMMON FAULTS:\n• Snatching the club away\n• Over-accelerating from the top\n• No pause at transition\n\nWHAT TO DO (Actionable Steps):\n• Count \"1-2\" back, \"3\" down\n• Swing at 70% speed for full sessions\n• Practice with metronome tempo drills\n\nFEEL / CUE:\n\"Smooth back — fast through\"\n\nPROGRESS CHECK:\nBall contact improves before distance increases."
