Weight Transfer Fundamentals

Proper weight transfer is essential for generating power in the golf swing. The weight should shift from the back foot to the front foot during the downswing, creating a powerful transfer of energy.

Key Principles:
- Weight starts on the back foot at address (approximately 50-50 or slightly back)
- During backswing, weight shifts to the back foot (trail foot)
- At the top of the swing, 70-80% of weight should be on the back foot
- During downswing, weight should transfer to the front foot
- At impact, 80-90% of weight should be on the front foot
- This weight transfer creates the foundation for power generation

Common Issues:
- Weight stuck on back foot: Golfer doesn't transfer weight forward, leading to weak shots
- Early weight shift: Weight moves forward too early in the swing, causing loss of power
- Insufficient transfer: Weight moves forward but not enough, reducing power potential

The weight transfer should feel like a smooth, athletic motion, similar to throwing a ball or stepping into a punch. The lower body leads the weight transfer, with the upper body following.
