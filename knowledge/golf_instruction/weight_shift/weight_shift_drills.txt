Weight Shift Practice Drills

Drill 1: Step Drill
Take your address position, then step forward with your front foot as you would in a normal swing. This helps you feel the weight transfer motion. Practice this 10-15 times to ingrain the feeling.

Drill 2: Wall Drill
Stand facing a wall with your front foot close to it. Practice your swing, focusing on transferring weight to the front foot. The wall provides feedback - you should feel your weight pressing into the front foot at impact.

Drill 3: Balance Drill
At the finish of your swing, hold the position for 5 seconds. If you can't hold it, your weight transfer wasn't complete. This teaches you to fully commit to the weight shift.

Drill 4: Slow Motion Practice
Practice your swing in slow motion, paying close attention to when and how your weight shifts. Feel the weight move from back foot to front foot in a smooth, controlled motion.

Drill 5: Impact Bag Drill
Hit an impact bag or heavy object, focusing on transferring your weight forward as you make contact. This helps you feel the power that comes from proper weight transfer.
