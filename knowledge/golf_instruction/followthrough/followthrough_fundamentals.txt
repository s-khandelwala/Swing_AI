Follow-Through Fundamentals

A complete follow-through is essential for a powerful, balanced golf swing. The follow-through is the natural result of a good swing, not something you force.

Key Principles:
- The club should finish high and around your body
- Your weight should be fully on your front foot
- Your belt buckle should face the target
- Your back foot should be up on the toe (not flat)
- Your chest should be facing the target
- You should be able to hold this position for several seconds

Common Issues:
- Incomplete follow-through: Stopping the swing too early, reducing power
- Off-balance finish: Unable to hold the finish position
- Poor weight transfer: Weight still on back foot at finish
- Incomplete rotation: Body not fully rotated toward target

The follow-through is a result of proper mechanics throughout the swing. If you have good weight transfer, rotation, and tempo, the follow-through will happen naturally.

A good drill is to practice holding your finish position for 5-10 seconds. If you can't hold it, your swing mechanics need work.

The finish position should feel balanced and athletic, like you've completed a powerful, controlled motion. You should feel like you could hold the position indefinitely.
