Tempo and Rhythm in the Golf Swing

Tempo refers to the speed of your swing, while rhythm refers to the smooth, consistent flow of the swing motion. Good tempo and rhythm create a repeatable, powerful swing.

Key Principles:
- The backswing should be smooth and unhurried, taking approximately 2-3 seconds
- The transition from backswing to downswing should be smooth, not rushed
- The downswing should accelerate smoothly, reaching maximum speed at impact
- The follow-through should be smooth and complete
- A good ratio is approximately 3:1 (backswing to downswing time)

Common Issues:
- Rushing the backswing: Causes loss of balance and power
- Jerky transition: Creates inconsistency and timing issues
- Over-acceleration: Trying to swing too hard, losing control
- Inconsistent tempo: Different speeds on different swings

The best swings have a smooth, flowing rhythm that feels effortless. Think of a pendulum or a metronome - consistent, rhythmic motion.

Professional golfers often use a count or phrase to maintain tempo, such as "one-two" or "smooth and easy."
