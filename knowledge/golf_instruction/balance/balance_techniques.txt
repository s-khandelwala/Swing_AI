Balance in the Golf Swing

Balance is fundamental to a good golf swing. Without proper balance, you cannot generate consistent power or accuracy.

Key Principles:
- Maintain balance throughout the entire swing
- Your center of gravity should remain stable
- Your head should stay relatively still (not bobbing up and down)
- Your feet should remain planted (no excessive movement)
- At the finish, you should be able to hold the position for several seconds

Common Issues:
- Swaying: Moving the body laterally too much during the swing
- Losing balance: Falling forward or backward during or after the swing
- Head movement: Excessive up and down or side to side movement
- Over-rotation: Turning too far, causing loss of balance

Balance starts with proper setup. Your stance should be athletic and stable, with your weight evenly distributed or slightly favoring the balls of your feet.

During the swing, focus on maintaining your center of gravity. The swing should feel controlled and balanced, not rushed or forced.

A good drill is to practice swings while standing on one foot (after you've mastered the basics). This exaggerates the need for balance and helps you develop better stability.
