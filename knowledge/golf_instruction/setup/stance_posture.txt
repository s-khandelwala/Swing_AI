Stance and Posture Fundamentals

Proper stance and posture are the foundation of a good golf swing. Without a solid foundation, it's impossible to make consistent, powerful swings.

Stance:
- Feet should be shoulder-width apart (slightly wider for driver, narrower for wedges)
- Weight should be evenly distributed or slightly on the balls of your feet
- Knees should be slightly flexed, not locked
- Feet should be parallel to the target line (or slightly open)

Posture:
- Spine should be angled forward from the hips (not from the waist)
- Back should be relatively straight, with a slight natural curve
- Shoulders should be relaxed and level
- Arms should hang naturally, not reaching or cramped
- Head should be up, eyes looking at the ball

The "S-Posture" is a common issue where the lower back curves too much inward. This can cause back pain and swing issues. Instead, maintain a neutral spine position.

Your posture should feel athletic and ready, like you're about to jump or throw a ball. You should feel balanced and stable, ready to make a powerful, controlled motion.

A good setup check: If someone could push you from the side and you wouldn't fall over, you're in a good athletic position.
