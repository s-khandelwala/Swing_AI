Body Rotation in the Golf Swing

Proper body rotation is crucial for generating power and maintaining consistency in the golf swing. The body should rotate around a stable spine angle, creating a coil-and-release motion.

Key Principles:
- The shoulders should rotate approximately 90 degrees in the backswing
- The hips should rotate approximately 45 degrees in the backswing
- This creates a "coil" or "X-factor" - the difference between shoulder and hip rotation
- During the downswing, the hips should start rotating first (leading the downswing)
- The shoulders follow the hips, creating a powerful uncoiling motion
- The rotation should be around a stable spine angle, not swaying

Common Issues:
- Over-rotation: Turning too far, causing loss of balance and control
- Under-rotation: Not turning enough, reducing power potential
- Swaying instead of rotating: Moving laterally instead of rotating around the spine
- Poor sequence: Hips and shoulders rotating together instead of sequentially

The rotation should feel like a coil spring - winding up in the backswing and releasing in the downswing. The lower body leads the downswing rotation, with the upper body following.

A good feel is to imagine your belt buckle pointing at the target at the finish of your swing. This ensures you've completed the rotation properly.
